                Margaret Evelyn Lenny "Maggie" Simpson[1][2] is a fictional character in the animated television series
                The Simpsons and a part of the Simpson family, notably the youngest member. She first appeared on
                television in the Tracey Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and
                designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. She
                received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for
                three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the Fox Broadcasting Company which debuted
                December 17, 1989.

                Maggie is the youngest child of Homer and Marge, and the younger sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often
                seen sucking on her orange pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her
                face (this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons). Being an infant, she has not yet learned
                how to talk. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracey Ullman Show short.

                Though she rarely talks, she frequently makes a characteristic sucking noise with her pacifier, which
                has become synonymous with the character. Her pacifier sucking noises are provided by the show's
                creator, Matt Groening, and early producer Gábor Csupó. Maggie's occasional speaking parts and other
                vocalizations are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars
                Carol Kane, James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and Jodie Foster, and by series regulars Yeardley Smith
                and Harry Shearer. Maggie has appeared in various media relating to The Simpsons – including video
                games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials and comic books – and has inspired an entire
                line of merchandise.
