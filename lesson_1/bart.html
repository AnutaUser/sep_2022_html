                Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson[1] is a fictional character and one of the two main protagonists,
                alongside his father Homer, in the American animated television series The Simpsons and part of the
                Simpson family.[2] He is voiced by Nancy Cartwright and first appeared on television in The Tracey
                Ullman Show short "Good Night" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed Bart
                while waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks' office. Groening had been called to pitch a series of
                shorts based on his comic strip, Life in Hell, but instead decided to create a new set of characters.
                While the rest of the characters were named after Groening's family members, Bart's name is an anagram
                of the word brat. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for two years, the Simpson family received
                its own series on Fox, which debuted December 17, 1989. Bart has appeared in every Simpsons episode
                except "Four Great Women and a Manicure".

                At ten years old, Bart is the eldest child and only son of Homer and Marge, and the brother of Lisa and
                Maggie. Bart's most prominent and popular character traits are his mischievousness, rebelliousness and
                disrespect for authority. Hallmarks of the character include his chalkboard gags in the opening
                sequence; his prank calls to Moe; and his catchphrases "Eat my shorts", "¡Ay, caramba!", "Don't have a
                cow, man!", and "I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?". However, with the exception of "Ay,
                caramba!", these hallmarks have been retired or are not often used. Bart has appeared in other media
                relating to The Simpsons – including video games, The Simpsons Movie, The Simpsons Ride, commercials,
                and comic books – and inspired an entire line of merchandise.

                In casting, Cartwright originally planned to audition for the role of Lisa, while Yeardley Smith tried
                out for Bart. Smith's voice was considered too high for a boy, so she was given the role of Lisa.
                Cartwright found Lisa uninteresting, so she instead auditioned for Bart, which she thought was a better
                role.[3]

                During the first two seasons of The Simpsons, Bart was the show's breakout character and "Bartmania"
                ensued, spawning Bart Simpson-themed merchandise touting his rebellious attitude and pride at
                underachieving, which caused many parents and educators to cast him as a bad role model for children.
                Around the third season, the series started to focus more on the family as a whole, though Bart still
                remains a prominent character. Time named Bart one of the 100 most important people of the 20th century,
                and he was named "entertainer of the year" in 1990 by Entertainment Weekly. Cartwright has won several
                awards for voicing Bart, including a Primetime Emmy Award in 1992 and an Annie Award in 1995. In 2000,
                Bart, along with the rest of his family, was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
